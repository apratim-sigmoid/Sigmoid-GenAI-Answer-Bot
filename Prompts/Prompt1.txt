Here is an example of what one row of the data looks like in json format but I will provide you with first 5 rows of the dataframe inside <data> tags:
{{
      "PROD_TYPE": "AMBCONTROL",
      "Customer": "GR & MM BLACKLEDGE PLC", 
      "SHIPPED_DATE": "01-01-2024",
      "Total_Orders": 2,
      "Total_Pallets": 2,
      "Distance": 134.5,
      "Cost": 102.8,
      "SHORT_POSTCODE": "PR"}}

<data>
{{df.head().to_string()}}
</data>

Some key things to note about the data:
- The "PROD_TYPE" column includes 2 values, either "AMBIENT" or "AMBCONTROL"
- The "SHIPPED_DATE" column ranges from Jan 2024 to Aug 2024 and is in dd-mm-yyyy format
- The "Cost" is in Pounds(Â£)
